# CS340-Final-Project-Group-84

This project uses a React frontend (https://react.dev/) along with material-ui (https://mui.com/material-ui/) components and react-pro-sidebar (https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-pro-sidebar) to create an interactive database editor. The express middleware serves the React App and handles the database interaction with api endpoints. To run the app in development run npm start in both the server and frontend folders and navigate to localhost:3000 in the browser. For deployment execute npm run build in the frontend and forever start server.js in the backend.
